{TEST 6.2.1-13, CLASS=QUALITY}

{: This test checks that a large number of labels (50) may be
   declared in a program. }
{  It is an attempt to detect a small processor limit on the
   number of labels. NOTE: A goto-statement whose label is
   attached to the immediately next statement is correct Pascal,
   and hence this program should be acceptable to a Standard
   Pascal processor.  The provision of warnings of this unusual
   situation is satisfactory, but rejecting the program is not. }
{V3.0: A note added to indicate that null gotos are correct Pascal.
   Program modified to actually use all labels.
   Was previously 6.2.1-9. }
