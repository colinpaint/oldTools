These are the UCSD filer source files System I.5,  filer version F.5
that I have faithfully preserved for 28 years!

The only changes have been to the file names so that MSDOS did not get
upset with the extra period in the name.

Current DOS name         UCSD PASCAL name

FILERA.TXT         ->    FILER.A.TEXT

FILERC.TXT         ->    FILER.C.TEXT
