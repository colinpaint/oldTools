USCD-Pascal source code
-----------------------


This directory contains source code for a historic Pascal compiler,
USCD-Pascal. USCD-Pascal introduced many innovations to the Pascal
language, including units, strings and untyped files. USCD-Pascal
also was the first compiler that could generate machine
independent byte code, and was therefore years ahead of Java.

The source code of USCD-Pascal is now available under a non-commercial
open source license. This code dates from 1978 and is propably one of
the oldest source codes you have ever seen.  Many source code files use
an ASCII carriage return as line break, so to study them you need a text
editor that recognizes this.
